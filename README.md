### NYCHA Apartment Inspections

#### Background and Objectives
The primary purpose of NYCHA apartment inspections is to identify and address maintenance and repair issues. This includes identifying problems such as leaks, structural issues, electrical problems, and other issues that may affect the safety and habitability of the apartments. By identifying these issues early, NYCHA can take steps to ensure that residents have safe and well-maintained living spaces. The objective of this project is to identify and investigate bad actors who can undermine the inspection process by not doing the work properly. 

#### Process and Approach
Labor transaction data, such as time to complete an inspection, the proportion of components in the unit that receive a satisfactory rating and access to the unit are used as measures to determine whether the inspection was completed properly.

#### Data and Methods
1. A direct connect to the NYCHA database to pull the data was established.
2. Data was cleaned, merged and quality checked.
3. Visualizations were create in Tableau to explore patterns in bad behavior.
4. Bad actor list is created using key process measures.

#### Results
##### Bad Actor List
The average inspection time is 39 minutes, during that time the inspector must answer 142 questions about the condition of apartment using a handheld device. The average satisfactory rate for inspectors who conduct over 100 inspections a year is 93%. The Bad Actor list includes inspectors with a low average inspection time and high satisfactory rates. A bad actor is defined as an inspection time average of 20 minutes or less and a satisfactory rate of 97 percent or higher.
