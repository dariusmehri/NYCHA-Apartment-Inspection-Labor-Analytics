### NYCHA Apartment Inspections

#### Background and Objectives
The primary purpose of NYCHA apartment inspections is to identify and address maintenance and repair issues. This includes identifying problems such as leaks, structural issues, electrical problems, and other issues that may affect the safety and habitability of the apartments. By identifying these issues early, NYCHA can take steps to address the problems and ensure that residents have safe and well-maintained living spaces. The objective of this project is to identify and investigate bad actors who can undermine the inspection process by not doing the work properly. 

#### Process and Approach
Labor transaction data, such as time to complete an inspection, the proportion of components in the unit that receive a satisfactory rating and access to the unit are used as measures to determine whether the inspection was completed properly.

#### Data and Methods
1. A direct connect to the NYCHA database to pull the data was established.
2. Data was cleaned, merged and quality checked.
3. Visualizations were create in Tableau to explore patterns in bad behavior.
